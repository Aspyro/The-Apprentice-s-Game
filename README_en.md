# The Apprentice's Game

The Apprentice Game is a game in which the player will be confronted with various knowledge, which he will have to assimilate to be able to advance. All, only by the game, and without studying!

The principle of this game will be to confront it with quests, quests that will be problems that will face the player. These quests will lead the player to learn a variety of subjects, ranging from simple mathematical addition to two terms, up to balance equations of momentum (in engineering sciences), all through mathematical knowledge, physical, chemical, astronomical and much more!

This game is potentially infinite both in its realization and in the entertainment capacity it can bring.

The only prerequisite to play this game (for now) is to read. Otherwise, the game would be playable by everyone!
